Thank you!!

Now, I want to put this in a docker containre. I want to be able to run and monitor this remotely.

Could we make a flask app that has a start|stop button
status of script - running, stopped
and basic terminal output in a box in the webpage?

I want to be able to run this thing without keeping my terminal open on my local machine.
